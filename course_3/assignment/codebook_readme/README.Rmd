## Summary

A single script--"run_analysis.R" was used to modify the data as provided by [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

## Packages

To run the script, the following packages are required:

* dplyr

* gsubfn

* readr

## Reading in the data

First, to read in the non testing and training data, readr's read_delim function was used with a delimiter of " ". For the testing and training data, readr's read_fwf file was used. There are 561 16-character columns.

## Labeling the data

The current dataset was created by second providing the x_test/train, y_test/train, and subject datasets with descriptive variable names. The x datasets received column names from a modified version of the features dataset (features)

## Combining the data

Third, the subject (subject_test/train) and y (y_test/train) datasets were column bound to their respective x datasets (x_test/train). 

Fourth, the resulting testing and training datasets were then row bound to each other. 

Fifth, the subsequent dataset was merged with the activity codebook (activity_labels) to provide descriptive activity names in the dataset. 

## Subsetting the data

Sixth, the data were subset to only activity and subject variables as well as those measurement variables including standalone mean and standard deviation.

## Analyzing the data

Seventh, the remaining measurement columns were averaged by activity and subject.
